    <h4>Description:</h4>
    <p>One of my takes on a korean beef bowl! A quick meal to make and a tasty one at that. Add this to your favorite rice, califlower rice or quinua and you will be happy you did. If you don't want as much spice, feel free to take out the Gochujang and if needed the Red Pepper flakes.</p>
    <p></p>
    <h4>Ingredients: (8 Servings)</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>2 LBs of Ground Beef (Lean)</li>
        <li>1 ½ Tablespoon Gochujang</li>
        <li>½ cup brown sugar, packed</li>
        <li>½ cup reduced sodium soy sauce</li>
        <li>4 teaspoons sesame oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon crushed red-pepper flakes, or more to taste</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground ginger</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
        <li>6 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>4 green onions, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon sesame seeds</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>In a small bowl, whisk together brown sugar, soy sauce, sesame oil, red pepper flakes and ginger.</li>
        <li>Heat vegetable oil in a large cast iron skillet over medium high heat. Add garlic and cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add ground beef and cook until browned, about 3-5 minutes, making sure to crumble the beef as it cooks; drain excess fat.</li>
        <li>Stir in soy sauce mixture and green onions until well combined, allowing to simmer until heated through, about 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Serve immediately, garnished with green onion and sesame seeds, if desired.</li>
    </ol>
